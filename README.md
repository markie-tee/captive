## Captive Portals for Fun

The idea is our captive portal allows users to view a sort of guestbook upon connection.
Portal admin may enforce policies for usage of their gateway.
Users --for instance at a Fraternity house, or recording studio-- will be presented with a click-through form.
In addition to a grid of tweets // images(?) posted by other guests.

* leave a message for a friend you missed.
* talk trash about your best friends.
* advertise your degeracy.

A business, for instance, might use the landing page for customer reviews.
A household might use it to leave family messages & engagements.
